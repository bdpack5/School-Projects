Observations on a (shortened) study of the Minimum Edit Distance function.

The algorithm's performance graph was a shallow exponential, which makes sense since we're making n*m computations. This is obviously far superior
to the recursive alternative, and with even a modest computer we can get results relatively quickly (though I was not able to process the full genomes
before the deadline for this assignment.) For a rapidly evolving virus, being able to parse data efficiently is self evidently important for any attempts 
to trace and contain specific strains. The table below shows the similarity scores at a depth of 1000 between all 14 strains. The Spanish strains(3-6) in 
particular are remarkably similar.
