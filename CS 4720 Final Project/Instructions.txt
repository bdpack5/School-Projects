The program was tested on a Windows machine using Cygwin. It requires no special libraries, so it should theoretic-
ally work on any machine.

The server program should be running first, make sure to run with 1 argument for the socket you wish to use.

The client program needs to run with 2 arguments, host address and port number. Once connected, the program should 
run.

The server will start with a play area deck, a main deck, and a hand, deck and personal play area for each player 
that connects. from there, you can fill those decks with cards, draw cards from one to another, and play specific 
cards from one to another, shuffle decks, check which cards are in a hand or deck, etc. 

I do not reccomend playing for stakes, since in it's current state any player can view any other players hand. We 
can only ask so much of human nature.
